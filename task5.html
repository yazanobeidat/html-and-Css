     <b> <p> The term “domestic dog” refers to any of several hundred breeds of dog in the world today. 
        While these animals vary drastically in appearance, every dog—from the Chihuahua to the Great Dane—is a member of the same species, 
        Canis familiaris. This separates domestic dogs from wild canines, such as coyotes, foxes, and wolves.</p></b>

    While its impossible to say exactly how a wild wolf species became a domesticated dog, most scientists believe the process happened gradually as wolves became more comfortable with humans.
     Perhaps wolves started down this path simply by eating human scraps. Many generations later, humans might have encouraged wolves to stay near by actively feeding them.
      Later still, those wolves may have been welcomed into the human home and eventually bred to encourage certain traits. All of this is thought to have unfolded over thousands of years.
